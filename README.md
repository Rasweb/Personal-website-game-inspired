## Overview

### Rasmus Personal Portfolio

Hello, my name is Rasmus Palm, a Frontend developer.

This is my personal portfolio where I used some layout inspiration from Steams UI.
I used Keen Slider to created the Image slider in the home page and I also used Icons8 for my icons in the about page.

Here you can find all my personal and work related public projects and also some info about me.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
